## CTL vs LTL

- Whilst an LTL formula's natural interpretation is over _paths_, CTL is a logic whose formulae are interpreted over _branching time_
  - branching time; over all possible _paths_ as opposed to *L*inear *T*ime which is over a **single** path.

## Peterson's Algorithm

- An algorithm for mutual exclusion that allows two or more processes to share a single use resource without conflict, using only _shared_ memory for communication.
